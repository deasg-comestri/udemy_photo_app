### by [Mashrur Hossain](https://mashrurhossain.com)


* Using Rails 6 (you'll need Rails 6 and all it's dependencies installed)

* Devise gem used to create a working User model

* Bootstrap 4.4 used for styling

Sample steps to use:

1) Clone the app and cd into the app directory

2) Re-set remote to your own repo

3) Bundle install to install all the gems necessary

4) Run rails db:migrate to create the users table

5) There might be a "Yarn packages are out of date error", if so you can run `yarn install --check-files` as recommended in the message. Then try step 4) again.

6) Run the rails server, preview in the browser and enjoy!
